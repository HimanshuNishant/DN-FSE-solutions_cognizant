(1) Understand Recursive Algorithms:

Q. Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem  by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.
Components of Recursion:
Base Case – Stops the recursion.
Recursive Case – Function calls itself with smaller input.
Call Stack – Manages function calls and returns.
